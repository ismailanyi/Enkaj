open each of these folders in vs code, one by one

enkaj-api is the backend, the rest are the front ends 

Then do the following ğŸ‘‡

e.g inside enkaj-api, open the terminal and run the command 
ğŸ‘‰ npm install, then ğŸ‘‰ npm start

Same thing for other folders
e.g inside the 'front-end' folder
ğŸ‘‰ npm install then ğŸ‘‰ npm run dev

inside the 'property-dashboard' folder
ğŸ‘‰ npm install then ğŸ‘‰ npm run dev
